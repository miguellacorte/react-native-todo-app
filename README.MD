## Functionality

The app allows users to create, read, update, and delete notes. Each note is limited in length to ensure they remain concise and to the point. This encourages users to capture the essence of their thoughts or tasks without getting bogged down in details.

## React Native

This project uses React Native, a popular framework for building mobile applications using JavaScript and React. It allows developers to build apps that run on both iOS and Android platforms.

## Setup Instructions with Expo

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your local machine.
2. Install Expo CLI by running `npm install -g expo-cli` in your terminal.
3. Clone the repository to your local machine.
4. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
5. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
6. Start the project by running `expo start`. This will launch the Expo Developer Tools in your web browser.
7. You can now run the app on your device by using the Expo Go app (available in the App Store and Google Play) or on an iOS or Android emulator. Simply scan the QR code shown in the Expo Developer Tools with the Expo Go app or follow the instructions in the terminal to launch the emulator.

## Cross-Platform Compatibility

One of the key advantages of React Native is its cross-platform compatibility. With the addition of Expo, this app works seamlessly on both iOS and Android devices, providing a consistent user experience across different platforms. Expo simplifies the process of developing, testing, and deploying React Native apps, making it an excellent choice for beginners and experienced developers alike.
